# **Project 1 Comic Characters**

## **Welcome to my first webpage!**

For this webpage, I've created a character finder that will find the bio, image, and stats of specific characters a user searches for from Marvel and DC comics. The API used also has information on characters outside of Marvel and DC, so get creative with your search!

### Technologies Used
For the webpage, I used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery

### Screenshots:

## Getting Started
- [My project's link](https://project-1-superheroes.vercel.app/)

## Plans for the Future
### For Future Enhancements of the Application:

- I'd like to customize the buttons more so that they look sleeker and more modern. Also adding a mouse hover over function.
- Work on keeping the photo in the center of the screen
- Try different color schemes for background. Playing with radial gradients was fun but I was having trouble finding a good color palette as a whole.
- Finally, linking more API's to the website that provide comic/tv/movie/video game appearances of each character so that the user can fully immerse themselves in the character they searched
